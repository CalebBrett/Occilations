# Occilations
I timed myself to make a game with the Unity game engine in 72 hours. The result is this game.

The first level was made to test the mechanics of the game. The user controls the ball which moves the pillars out of the way the number keys can be used to change the balls colour and will paint the pillars nearby that colour. The picture below shows this level.

The following levels have the player move throuhg a maze while moving the white pillars out of the way. The black pillars cannot be moved and the blue pillars move on thier own in a wave motion. In the picture below you can see these different types of pillars.
